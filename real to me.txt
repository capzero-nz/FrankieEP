i’ve been in bed for days, your pictures lighting up my face
I know I shouldn't search your name, but I'll do it anyway
Are you fine? Are you with your friends or are you forgetting all about it?
Do you cry or get drunk instead? Were we something I'd imagined?
Was it real to you? It was real to me
Were there parts of us you were questioning,
you were such a big deal to me,
big deal to me
Was it real to you? Did you cry for me?
When we fell apart, did you feel a thing?
You were such a big deal to me, it was real to me
It was real to me
You said you don't see a future in us, can I say that we dated, is that what it was?
And I can't get a word out of you when we talk, say you don't have the heart now to just break it off
We were drunk in your car and the truth came undone
And the knot in my stomach appeared, now you're gone
And the thing that you got off your chest was my heart, but you don't seem to care anymore
Was it real to you? It was real to me
Were there parts of us you were questioning?
You were such a big deal to me, big deal to me
Was it real to you? Did you cry for me?
When we fell apart, did you feel a thing?
You were such a big deal to me, it was real to me, it was real to me
When you gave me your promise it'd always be us
Were you always dishonest? Did I dream it up?
The ‘i love you’s were real to me, a big deal to me, I meant everything.
