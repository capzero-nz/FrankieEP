Honey, why you switching up?
You know I don't get it, you act like you don't give a fuck
Why you putting on a show? It's funny
You always wanna hold me, but never wanna know me, but you're just another sad clown
Oh, how you like me now?
Out with your friends, trouble in the next, just getting by 'til your next pack of cigarettes
Generations, fucked, shit out of luck, everybody running around doing too much
And I don't really wanna deal with these emotions
Like turning up to the store when it's closing
Honey, why you switching up?
You know I don't get it, you act like you don't give a fuck
Why you putting on a show? It's funny
You always wanna hold me, but never wanna know me, but you're just another sad clown
Oh, how you like me now?
Oh, how you like me now?
Sometimes I don't know why you do this
Taking hints from who you're in the room with
You think I'm mad but I'm not. No you can't come back, can't cancel your spot
I hate to tell you I'm breaking off
That's how it is when we're better off
Honey, why you switching up?
You know I don't get it, you act like you don't give a fuck
Why you putting on a show? It's funny
You always wanna hold me, but never wanna know me, but you're just another sad clown
Oh, how you like me now?
Honey, why you switching up?
You know I don't get it, you act like you don't give a fuck
Why you putting on a show? It's funny
You always wanna hold me, but never wanna know me, but you're just another sad clown
Oh, how you like me now?
