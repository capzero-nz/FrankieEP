I admit I walked in like I was doing fine
never question, never worry ‘bout another guy
Turn my phone off no distraction for my peace of mind

I'll find love in somebody else
Do you think about me it's hard to tell
bet you're doing better now and I wish you well
Everybody's always thinking I'm the bad guy
Saying it won't work and it's never the right time
But can you stay with me even if it's for the night?
She said that she's leaving
when no one is around to see it
I don't know how to tell you i need you 
and she meant every word I can't stop her, no it's over
She's leaving
and no one is around to see it
I don't know how to tell you, I need you
and she meant every word I can't stop her, no it's over
It's not like me to still care
I don't miss you anywhere
You try to fill the hole without me
And you can call it off, or call it what you want
Call my bluff and tell me it's a front
But you’ll want me back when all is said and done
Everybody's always thinking I'm the bad guy
Saying it won't work and it's never the right time
But can you stay with me even if it's for the night?
She said that she's leaving
when no one is around to see it
I don't know how to tell ya, I need ya
and she meant every word I can't stop her, no it's over
She's leaving
when no one is around to see it
I don't know how to tell you, I need you
and she meant every word I can't stop her, no it's over
