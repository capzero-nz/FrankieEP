Seven days a week
Keep both of your eyes on me
Stay here and don't leave
Making up for lost time, can we
Lose all of our sleep
Our stars are aligned maybe
Ill Start calling you mine, baby
I want you alone now, baby come home now, maybe I'm selfish
The rumours i love you, maybe they're all true and I can't help it
I don't wanna see you with anyone else now, baby excuse me
But I can't help it, I want you all to myself, yeah, I'm selfish
Oh, I've been up late and I've been thinking, who were you out with, what were you drinking?
Not that I care, but was anyone handsy? I don't wanna share you, is that a bad thing?
What if you were all mine, keep you on my good side, I would always treat you like you're royalty
And maybe if it feels right, we could get the knot tied, you could be a loyal to me
I want you alone now, baby come home now, maybe I'm selfish
The rumours, maybe they're all true, and I can't help it
I don't wanna see you with anyone else now, baby excuse me
But I can't help it, I want you all to myself, yeah, I'm selfish
