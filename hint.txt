Generational heartthrob, he's so infatuated wrote me a love song,
But is there a switch i could shut off, 'cause now I'm looking in his eyes and they're bloodshot
But baby, it's only your money that you're wasting,
buy me another of the same drink
Doesn't know we're playing for the same team
He plays guitar in a cool band, cool friends and cool clothes with his cool fans
Thinks i hang on his sweater, he's not smart but he don't know any better
Don't hate me, you and I are looking for the same things
Arm around my shoulder got me shaking
Doesn't know we're playing for the same team
He's so oblivious, trying to get me to go home with him
But he don't know me like I know him,
can't pick up on a hint
He calls me over and says nothing at all
I'm so uninterested, but it's not his fault
was nice to meet ya and nicer to leave ya
I wanna tell him no but I'm not his teacher
I want somebody with different features,
different sneakers, but he's into FIFA
He's so oblivious, trying to get me to go home with him
But he don't know me like I know him,
can't pick up on a hint
He's so oblivious, trying to get me to go home with him
But he don't know me like I know him,
can't pick up on a hint
