Back of the car, going 90 way too far
Don't wanna miss my set at 6 
And I'm distracted when I'm not with you
I wish you could be here to sing this wrong 
And sure my life is busy when I'm touring different cities
and yeah you think it's pretty cool
Don't think you want something from me, yeah I only want you on me
I'll travel the world just to see my girl
A thousand faces, going different places
I don't care, I just want you here
Pack you in my bag, you're so cute it makes me sad
and I don't care, I just want you here
A thousand different meanings, gotta pack up all my feelings
Sleep through all my alarms
And yeah we're both exhausted, but this is what we wanted
(ill call you if it gets too hard)
Feel like a loser, focus on my future
I haven't seen you in so long
And sure your life is busy when we're both in different cities
Yeah there's something missing, I should just be kissing you
A thousand faces, going different places
I don't care, I just want you here
Pack you in my bag, you're so cute it makes me sad
and I don't care, I just want you here
So wont you come on over, I can lean onto your shoulder
And we're only getting older, this window seats getting colder
So won't you love me honey, and just say that youre proud of me
cause your words of affirmation, will beat any destination
But don't need you to praise me, just wanna be with my lady
Whisper in my ear, wanna keep you near
I can't stand being alone, wont leave my house 'cause you're my home
I don't care, I just want you here
