Remember we got halfway to Paris till it wasn't what you imagined
It Lost its magic
I still think we could have worked if you let it 
You got internalised shit with your parents 
and I can't fix it for you 
Oysters and caviar, putting things on your mom's card
Taking out the Porsche and nearly crash it going way too hard
Am I different than you thought I was? Did you think that I'd like all this stuff?
Or is who I am just not enough for you, for you?
I can't, I don't wanna listen
Don't say that we're too different
This Could've worked if you let it
Shit admit you gave up on the idea of us
I let you in, you're the one
Feel so dumb. Just forget it
Are you the same person that you were at the start?
Walking 'round collecting souvenirs of other people's hearts
You want me here but not because you're in love like you said you were
Keep me around to fill a hole that you know is unfillable
Oysters and caviar, putting things on your mom's card
Taking out the Porsche and nearly crash it going way too hard
Am I different than you thought I was? Did you think that I'd like all this stuff?
Or is who I am just not enough for you, for you?
I can't, I don't wanna listen. Don't say that we're too different
Could've worked if you let it
Shit admit you gave up on the idea of us
I let you in, you're the one. Feel so dumb. Just forget it
