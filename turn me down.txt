I'll leave the light on when you get in bed 'cause I know that you'll be out again
as fast as you walked in
You're always looking around behind you even when I'm right beside you
What are you scared to do?
And I could just lay here, put all my pride aside and wait here, given you my best parts for two years, just for you to be undecided
And you could have seen it coming, the car was crashing, you steered it off a cliff
How did we get where we did?
You'll scream and I'll shout, turn me on and turn me down
Say you can't live without me and you want to work things out
Don't know if you're selfish or irresponsible 
I wouldn't know, I shut you out while I was drowning in my room and you were over at her house
You wanna be alone but too selfish to let me go
Force myself not to read into your texts
Can't control what you're gonna do next
And if you need me, you really should have wanted to see me
I shouldn't feel more when I'm even speaking
You got me needy
And I could just lay here, put all my pride aside and wait here, giving you my best parts for two years, just for you to be undecided
And you could have seen it coming, the car was crashing, you steered it off a cliff
How did we get where we did?
You'll scream and I'll shout, turn me on and turn me down
Say you can't live without me and you want to work things out
Don't know if you're selfish or irresponsible
But I wouldn't know, I shut you out while I was drowning in my room and you were over at her house
